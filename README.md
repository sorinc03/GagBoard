The GagBoard/MemeFlicker project started as a concept related to viewing posts on websites like 9gag.com in a different way.

Instead of scrolling horizontally or vertically between posts, the user, I was given the idea of trying to implement an omniscrolling scroll view that would load images in any direction.

The existing code currently does that but is in a few ways quite buggy - image loading is slow - partially due to the fact that one needs to load each gag's page separately as there's no API to retrieve images quickly and load "on the go". In other ways, I have realised that this might not be a very user friendly way of browsing contents of the website anyway and thus decided to shelf the project for now.

Feel free to fork the project and change the code. I'll happily accept pull requests for useful contributions.
